Apache setup for the SenseWorld Data Network</A>

<P>
You need to install a webserver such as Apache on the host system.
(package apache2 on Debian/Ubuntu; usually available on OSX)<br>
The general files will be put in /var/www. You have to make this directory
writable by the user by executing (as root)<br>

<pre>
$ cd /var/www
$ chmod 775 .
$ chgrp netdev .
</pre>

Assuming that the user running SuperCollider is member of the group netdev.
You can check this by:
<pre>
$ groups
</pre>
</P>
<P>

To add yourself to the group, execute as root (with instead of "nescivi" your
username):
<pre>$ adduser nescivi netdev</pre>
You may need to logout and log back in for this to take effect.
</P>

<P>
You should also make sure that apache is running. The following command should give you a number of processes named apache2
<pre>
$ ps -A | grep apache
</pre>
If it is not running, you can start it with (path shown as it is on Debian)
<pre>
$ (sudo) /etc/init.d/apache2 start
</pre>
</P>

<P>
On OSX the default path for http files is: /Library/WebServer/Documents/.
You may have to enable "Web Sharing" in the "Sharing" settings in the System
Preferences.
